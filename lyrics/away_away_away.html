	Away, Away, Away

	Come ye daring young buccaneers,
	come and capture your treasure!
	Sail with us on the seven seas,
	And find your richest reward!
	Live the dream and you’ll find a world,
	filled with gold beyond measure,
	Bid farewell to your landlocked friends,
	and matey climb aboard!
	Chorus:
	Away, away, away, away
	Come live the life, the life we love
	Away, away, away, away
	Adventure’s waiting for you!
	Come ye brave young buccaneers
	Come live the life, the pirates life
	Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
	Come live the life we love!
	Waving a sword in each hand
	We’re off to far away lands
	Away, away, away, away
	Come the life we love
	When you see Tortuga’s coast,
	Oi yer gunna be smilin’
	The songs, the fights, the days, the nights,
	There’s so much to behold!
	Sail with us on a western wind,
	see the beautiful islands!
	Sail with us and we’ll cross the earth,
	In search of silver and gold!
	[Chorus]
	Come ye brave young buccaneers
	Come live the life, the pirates life
	Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
	Come live the life we love!
	Waving a sword in each hand
	We’re off to far away lands
	Away, away, away, away
	Come the life we love
	A Pirate fights for his treasure mate, be ready with your cutlass,
	But then there is the party,
	that’s the part he likes the best!
	When we sail into your port,
	heros you will be boys/girls!
	A patch on yer eye, and a nice feather too!
	A Pirate is what you will be!
	[Chorus]
