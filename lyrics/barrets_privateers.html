	Barrettâ€™s Privateers

	Oh, the year was 1778,
	How I wish I was in Sherbrooke Now!
	A letter of marque came from the king,
	To the scummiest vessel I'd ever seen,
	Chorus:
	God DARN it all!
	I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
	We'd fire no guns-shed no tears
	Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
	The last of Barrett's Privateers.
	Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
	How I wish I was in Sherbrooke Now!
	For twenty brave men all fishermen who
	Would make for him the Antelope's crew
	[Chorus]
	The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight,
	How I wish I was in Sherbrooke Now!
	She'd a list to the port and and her sails in rags
	And the cook in scuppers with the staggers and the jags
	[Chorus]
	Then at length we stood two cables away,
	How I wish I was in Sherbrooke Now!
	Our cracked four pounders made an awful din
	But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
	[Chorus]
	The Antelope shook and pitched on her side,
	How I wish I was in Sherbrooke Now!
	Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
	And the Main trunk carried off both me legs
	[Chorus]
	So here I lay in my 23rd year,
	How I wish I was in Sherbrooke Now!
	It's been 6 years since we sailed away
	And I just made Halifax yesterday
	[Chorus End]
