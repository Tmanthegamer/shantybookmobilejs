	Beneath the Black Flag

	Out on the endless ocean
	We tear along the gales
	With rum inside our bellies warm and freedom in our sails
	A wayward bunch of scoundrels
	Assassins, thieves and slaves
	The rich and blue bloods fear us when we hunt upon the waves
	And when you see it coming
	That flag of baleful black
	No point in turning tail there’s no escaping our attack!
	Chorus:
	YO-HO!
	YO-HO!
	We row beneath the black flag A rollickin’ we go!
	We own the sea & sky
	YO-HO!
	YO-HO!
	We row beneath the black flag A rollickin’ we go!
	We bleed the kingdoms dry!!
	Defy the odds against us
	A pirate knows no fear
	Our steel is ready and our retribution is severe 
	We plunder from the greedy
	With blood and with our steel
	We rob the rich of their Ill-gotten gain & make them kneel
	Behold the oceans’s mysteries
	The tales of ancient deeds
	We follow in the footsteps of a silent secret creed
	Come On!!!
	YO-HO! YO-HO!
	We row beneath the black flag
	A rollickin’ we go!
	We own the sea & sky
	YO-HO! YO-HO!
	We row beneath the black flag
	A rollickin’ we go!
	We bleed the kingdoms dry!!
	Again!!!
	(Chorus x2 End)
	YO-HO! YO-HO!
	We row beneath the black flag
	A rollickin’ we go!
	We own the sea & sky
	YO-HO! YO-HO!
	We row beneath the black flag
	A rollickin’ we go!
	We bleed the kingdoms dry!
	Huzzah!!!
	(End)
