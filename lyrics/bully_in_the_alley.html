	Bully in the Alley

	(Chorus)
	Help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley,
	Wey hey eh ey, Bully in the alley
	Help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley,
	Bully down in Shinbone al
	Sally is a girl that I loved dearly,
	Wey hey eh, Bully in the alley
	Sally is the girl that I spliced nearly,
	Bully down in Shinbone al
	(Chorus)
	For seven long years I courted little Sally,
	Wey hey eh, Bully in the alley
	All She did was dilly and dally,
	Bully down in Shinbone al
	(Chorus)
	I left my Sal, I went-a-sailing
	Wey hey eh, Bully in the alley
	Signed on a big ship, I went whaling
	Bully down in Shinbone al
	(Chorus)
	If ever I get back, I'll marry little Sally,
	Wey hey eh, Bully in the alley
	Have six kids and live in Shinbone alley,
	Bully down in Shinbone al
	I thought I heard the old man saying,
	Wey hey eh, Bully in the alley
	One more pull and we're belaying,
	Bully down in Shinbone al
	(Chorus End)
	Help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley,
	Wey hey eh ey, Bully in the alley
	Help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley, Bully down in Shinbone al
