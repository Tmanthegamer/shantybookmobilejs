        <p class="line">Farewell to Nova Scotia, you sea-bound coast</p> 
        <p class="line">Let your mountains dark and dreary be</p>
        <p class="line">For when I am far away on the briny ocean tossed 
        <p class="line">Will you ever heave a sigh and a wish for me?</p>

    <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line">The sun was setting in the west         </p>
        <p class="line">The birds were singing on every tree    </p>
        <p class="line">All nature seemed inclined for to rest  </p>
        <p class="line">But still there was no rest for me      </p>

        <p class="line">I grieve to leave my native land              </p>
        <p class="line">I grieve to leave my comrades all             </p>
        <p class="line">And my parents whom I held so dear            </p>

        <p class="line">So farewell, farewell to Nova Scotia’s charms       </p>

        <p class="line">I have three brothers and they are at rest     </p>
        <p class="line">Their arms are folded on their breast          </p>
        <p class="line">But a poor simple sailor just like me          </p>
        <p class="line">Must be tossed and driven on the dark blue sea </p>
