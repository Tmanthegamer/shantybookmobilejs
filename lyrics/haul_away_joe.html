	Haul Away Joe

	When I was a little boy so my mother told me, (to me)
	Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe
	That if I did not kiss the girls,
	my lips would all grow mouldy, (to me)
	Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe
	Chorus:
	Way haul away, we're bound for better weather, (to me)
	Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe
	First I met a Yankee girl and she was dumb and lazy, (to me)
	Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe
	Then I met an Irish girl, she damn near drove me crazy, (to me)
	Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe
	(Chorus)
	King Louis was the king of France before the revolution, (to me)
	Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe
	And then he got his head cut off,
	it spoiled his constitution, (to me)
	Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe
	(Chorus)
	Way haul away, the good ship is a rolling,(to me)
	Way haul away, we'll haul away Joe_
	(End)
