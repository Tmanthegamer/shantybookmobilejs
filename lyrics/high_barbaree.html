High Barbaree

There were two lofty ships from old England came
Blow high, blow low, and so sail we
One was the Prince of Luther and the other Prince of Wales
Sailin’ down the coast of High Barbary
"Aloft there, aloft there" our jolly bosun cried
Blow high, blow low, and so sail we
"Look ahead, look astern, Look to weather an' a-lee"
Sailin’ down the coast of High Barbary
"There's naught upon the stern, sir, there's naught upon our lee
Blow high, blow low, and so sail we
But there's a lofty ship to wind'ard an' she's sailin' fast and free"
Sailin’ down the coast of High Barbary
"Oh hail her, oh hail her" our gallant captain cried
Blow high, blow low, and so sail we
"Are you a man-o-war or a privateer?" cried he
Sailin’ down the coast of High Barbary
"Oh, I'm not a man-o-war nor privateer," said he
Blow high, blow low, and so sail we
"But I am salt sea pirate all a-looking for me fee"
Sailin’ down the coast of High Barbary
For Broadside, for broadside a long time we lay
Blow high, blow low, and so sail we
Til at last the Prince of Luther shot the pirate's mast away
Sailin’ down the coast of High Barbary
"Oh quarter, oh quarter" those pirates they did cry
Blow high, blow low, and so sail we
But the quarter that we gave them was we sank 'em in the sea
Sailin’ down the coast of High Barbary
