Hoist The Colours

Chorus:
Yo Ho, haul together
Hoist the Colours High
Heave Ho, Thieves and Beggars,
Never Shall we Die
The King and his men stole
the Queen from her bed
and bound her in her bones
The seas be ours
and by the powers
where we will we'll roam
(Chorus)
Some men have died
and some are alive
and others sail on the sea
with the keys to the cage
and the Devil to pay
we lay to the fiddler's green
(Chorus)
The bell has been raised (ring bell)
from it's watery grave...
Do you hear it's sepulchral tone?
We are a call to all
pay head the squall
and turn your sail towards home
(Chorus End)
