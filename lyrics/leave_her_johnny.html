Leave Her Johnny

Well I thought I heard the old man say
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
You can go ashore and take your pay,
And it's time for us to leave her
Chorus:
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
Woahâ€¦
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
When the voyage is done,
and the winds don't blow
And It's time for us to leave her
(Chorus)
The winds were foul, and the work was hard,
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
From the Gray's Harbour Docks to the Steveston Yard
And its time for us to leave her
(Chorus)
The winds were foul, and the ship was slow
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
The grub was bad, and the wages low
And it's time for us to leave her
(Chorus)
History: Pumping/Capstan Shanty. Sung with the ship at port & the
last pumping of the bilge before disembarking the ship.

You can make her mast and pack your gear
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
You can leave her moored at the Steveston pier
And it's time for us to leave her
(Chorus)
The sails are furled and the work is done,
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
We will go ashore and have our fun
And its time for us to leave her
(Chorus)
The wind were foul, and the trip was long
Leave her, Johnny, Leave her
But before we go
we will sing this song
And it's time for us to leave her
(No concertina)
And it's time for us to leave her (End)
