Lowlands

I dreamed a dream the other night,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, me John
My love she came all dressed in white,
Lowlands away
I dreamed my love came in my sleep,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, me John
Her cheeks were wet, her eyes did weep
Lowlands away
She came to me at my bed-side,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, me John
Dressed all in white like some fair bride
Lowlands away
And bravely in her bosom fair,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, me John
A red, red rose my love did wear
Lowlands away
She made no sound-no word she said,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, me John
And then I knew my love was dead
Lowlands away
I bound the weeper round my head,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, me John
For now I knew my love was dead
Lowlands away
She waved her hand-she said goodbye,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, me John
I wiped the tear from out my eye
Lowlands away
And then awoke to hear the cry,
Lowlands, Lowlands, away, me John
'Oh, watch on deck, oh, watch ahoy!'
Lowlands away (End)
