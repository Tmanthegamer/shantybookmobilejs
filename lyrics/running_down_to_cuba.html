	Running down to Cuba

	Running down to Cuba with a load of sugar,
	Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
	Make her run you, lime juice squeezes,
	Running down to Cuba
	Chorus:
	Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
	Running down to Cuba
	O, I got a sister, she's nine feet tall,
	Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
	Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall,
	Running down to Cuba
	(Chorus)
	The captain he will trim the sails,
	Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
	Winging the water over the rails,
	Running down to Cuba
	(Chorus) 
	Give me a gal can dance Fandango,
	Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
	Round as a melon and sweet as a mango,
	Running down to Cuba
	(Chorus)
	Load this sugar and home-ward go,
	Weigh, me boys, to Cuba!
	Mister mate, he told me so,
	Running down to Cuba
	(Chorus End)
