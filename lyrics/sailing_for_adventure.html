Sailing for Adventure

When the course is laid and the anchor's weighed,
A sailor's blood begins racing.
With our hearts unbound and our flag unfurled,
-We're underway and off to see the world!
*Underway and off to see the world!*
Hey, ho, we'll go anywhere the wind is blowing
-Manly men are we!
Sailing for adventure on the deep blue sea.
Danger walks the deck; we say what the heck
We laugh at the perils we're facing
-Every storm we ride is its own reward
-And people die by falling overboard!
*People die by falling overboard!*
Hey, ho, we'll go anywhere the wind is blowing
Hoist the sails and sing!
-Sailing for adventure on the big blue wet thing.
-I love to see them cry when they walk the plank
-I prefer to cut a throat
-I like to hang 'em high and watch their little feet try to walk in the air
while their faces turn blue!
(awkward pause)-Just kidding!
It's a good life on a boat!
There are distant lands with burning sands
That call across the ocean
-There are bingo games every fun-filled day
-And margaritas at the midnight buffet!
*Margaritas at the midnight buffet!*
Hey, ho, we'll go anywhere the wind is blowing!
-Should have took a train!
Sailing for adventure on the bounding main!
-The salty breezes whisper; who knows what lies ahead?
I just know I was born to lead the life my father led!
-The stars will be our compass, wherever we may roam
And our mates will always be just like our family
And though we may put into port, the sea is always home!
We'll chase our dreams standing on our own,
Over the horizon to the great unknown!
Hey, ho, we'll go anywhere the wind is blowing!
Bold and brave and free
Sailing for adventure
-It's so nauseating!
Sailing for adventure
-So exhilirating!
Sailing for adventure
-We're all celebrating!
On the deep blue sea!
