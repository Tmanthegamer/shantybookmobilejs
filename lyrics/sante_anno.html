Sante Anno

O’ The navy never would have a lad/lass like me.
Away Sante Anno
So I went in search of piracy,
along the coasts of Mexico
Chorus:
So heave her up
and away we’ll go
Away Sante Anno
To Mexico where the warm winds blow,
all along the coasts of Mexico
Those Mexican girls/boys I do adore.
Away Sante Anno
With their shining eyes, and coal black hair,
along the coasts of Mexico
[Chorus]
So now we sail to the southern seas,
Away Sante Anno
We’ll have those Navy Lads/Lasses on their knees,
along the coasts of Mexico.

When I was a young and in me prime.
Away Sante Anno
I danced those girls/boys two at a time
along the coasts of Mexico
[Chorus]
The Skipper like whiskey, the mate likes rum,
Away Sante Anno
The crew likes both but we can’t get none,
along the coasts of Mexico.
[Chorus]
Why should I leave the sea and settle down?
Away Sante Anno
I heard there is gold in every town,
along the coasts of Mexico
[Chorus]
slowly….
Now the work was hard and the wages low,
Away Sante Anno
But a pirates life is roll and go,
along the coasts of Mexico!
