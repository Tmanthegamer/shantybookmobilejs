        <p class="line">I heard many stories both lovely and wild               </p>
        <p class="line">About the great dragons and monsters that be            </p>
        <p class="line">That swallow the ships when they sail on the sea        </p>
        <p class="line">Though I was an artist with canvas and paints I sailed  </p>
        <p class="line">with St. Brendan and his jolly saints                   </p>
        <p class="line">We told the good people good-bye for a while            </p>

        <p class="line">We'd been on the ocean for ninety four days       </p>
        <p class="line">We came to a spot where the sea was ablaze        </p>
        <p class="line">Those demons from Hades were dancing with glee    </p>
        <p class="line">And burning the sailors alive on the sea          </p>
        <p class="line">Then St. Brendan walked on the blistering waves   </p>
        <p class="line">He threw all the demons right back to their caves </p>
        <p class="line">And all of the saints wore a heavenly smile       </p>

        <p class="line">One night while the brethren were lying asleep     </p>
        <p class="line">A great dragon came up from under the deep         </p>
        <p class="line">He thundered and lightened and made a great din He </p>
        <p class="line">awakened St. Brendan and all of his men            </p>
        <p class="line">The dragon came up with his mouth opened wide      </p>
        <p class="line">We threw in a cross and the dragon died            </p>
        <p class="line">We skinned him and cooked and feasted awhile       </p>
