        <p class="line">When I was a lass on the Emerald Isle
        <p class="line">I heard many stories both lovely and wild
        <p class="line">About the great dragons and monsters that be
        <p class="line">That swallow the ships when they sail on the sea
        <p class="line">Though I was an artist with canvas and paints I sailed
        <p class="line">with St. Brendan and his jolly saints
        <p class="line">We told the good people good-bye for a while

        <p class="line">We sailed for St. Brendan's Fair Isle, Fair Isle We

    <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line">We'd been on the ocean for ninety four days
        <p class="line">We came to a spot where the sea was ablaze
        <p class="line">Those demons from Hades were dancing with glee
        <p class="line">And burning the sailors alive on the sea
        <p class="line">Then St. Brendan walked on the blistering waves
        <p class="line">He threw all the demons right back to their caves
        <p class="line">And all of the saints wore a heavenly smile
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line">One night while the brethren were lying asleep
        <p class="line">A great dragon came up from under the deep
        <p class="line">He thundered and lightened and made a great din He
        <p class="line">awakened St. Brendan and all of his men
        <p class="line">The dragon came up with his mouth opened wide
        <p class="line">We threw in a cross and the dragon died
        <p class="line">We skinned him and cooked and feasted awhile

    <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line">At last we came unto a beautiful land
        <p class="line">We all went ashore and we walked on the sand
        <p class="line">We took our long bows and killed a Zebu
        <p class="line">We roasted it up and had hot barbecue
        <p class="line">And after awhile we were singing a song
        <p class="line">We noticed the island was moving along
        <p class="line">We ate and we drank and we rode in high style

    <div class="stanza">
        <p class="line">Now Brendan said crew it is much to my wish
        <p class="line">We ride on the back of the world's biggest fish
        <p class="line">Hold fast to the rope that is pulling the ship
        <p class="line">We'll need it someday if this fish take a dip
        <p class="line">We sailed every ocean we sailed every sea
        <p class="line">We sailed every spot that a sailor could be
        <p class="line">In forty four days we sailed ten million miles
