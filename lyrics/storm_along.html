	Storm Along

	Old Stormie's gone that good old man,
	wey hey, Storm-along!
	Old Stormie's gone, that good old man,
	aye, aye, Mister Storm-along!
	They dug his grave with a silver spade,
	wey hey, Storm-along!
	His shroud of finest silk was made,
	aye, aye, Mister Storm-along!
	They lowered him with a golden chain,
	wey hey, Storm-along!
	Their eyes all dim with more than rain,
	aye, aye, Mister Storm-along!
	An able sailor, bold and true,
	 wey hey, Storm-along!
	A good old skipper to his crew,
	aye, aye, Mister Storm-along!
	He's moored at last, and furled his sail,
	wey hey, Storm-along!
	No danger now from wreck or gale,
	aye, aye, Mister Storm-along!
	Old Stormy has heard an angel call,
	wey hey, Storm-along!
	So sing his dirge now, one and all,
	aye, aye, Mister Storm-along!
