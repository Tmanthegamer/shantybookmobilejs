The Fish of the Sea

Come all you young sailor men, listen to me,
I'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea; And it's...
(Chorus) Windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys,
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys; Blow ye
winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow, Jolly sou'wester
boys, steady she goes.
Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail,
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail; And it's...
(Chorus)
Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth,
Saying, "You eat the dough, boys, and I'll eat the beef!" And it's...
(Chorus)
Up jumps the lobster with his heavy claws,
Bites the main boom right off by the jaws! And it's...
(Chorus)
Up jumps the halibut, lies flat on the deck, He says,
"Mister Captain, don't step on my neck!" And it's...
(Chorus)
Up jumps the herring, the king of the sea, Saying, "All
other fishes, now you follow me!" And it's...
(Chorus) 
Up jumps the codfish with his chuckle-head, He runs out up
forward and throws out the lead! And it's...
(Chorus)
Up jumps the whale, the largest of all,
"If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall!" And it's...
