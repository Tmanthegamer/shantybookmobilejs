What Do You Do
With A Drunken Sailor?

Chorus:
What do you do with a drunken sailor,
What do you do with a drunken sailor,
What do you do with a drunken sailor, Earl-eye
in the morning!
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Earl-eye in the morning
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Shave his belly with a rusty razor, Earl-eye
in the morning!
(Chorus)
Put him the long boat until he’s sober,
Put him the long boat until he’s sober,
Put him the long boat until he’s sober, Earl-eye
in the morning!
(Chorus)
(Alternates)
Tickle him with a feather until he sneezes
Use his hat to clean the poop deck
Hang him from the yardarm until he's sober Give him a hair from the dog
that bit him
Put in the scuppers with a hose pipe on him
Put him in the bilge and make him drink it
Lock him in the brig with the Captain’s daughter
That’s what you do with a Drunken Sailor! (End)
