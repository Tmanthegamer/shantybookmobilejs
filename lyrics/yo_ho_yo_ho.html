	Yo Ho, Yo Ho
	(“It’s a Pirate’s Life For Me”)

	Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
	We pillage, we plunder, we rifle and loot
	Drink up me hearties, yo ho
	We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot
	Drink up me hearties, yo ho
	Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
	We extort and pilfer, we filch and sack Drink up me hearties, yo ho
	Maraud and embezzle and even highjack
	Drink up me hearties, yo ho
	Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
	We kindle and char and enflame and ignite
	Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
	We burn up the city, we're really a fright
	Drink up me hearties, yo ho
	We're rascals and scoundrels, we're villains and knaves
	Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
	We're devils and black sheep, we're really bad eggs
	Drink up me hearties, yo ho 
	Yo ho, you ho, a pirate's life for me
	 We're beggars and blighters and ne'er do-well cads,
	Drink up me hearties, yo ho
	Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads,
	Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
	Yo ho, you ho, a pirate's life for me
	(END)
